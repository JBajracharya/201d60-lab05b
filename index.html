            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Jitendra Bajracharya. I'm a software development 
                Engineer apprentice at Amazon and currently receiving training through code fellows.
                Previously, I graduated from another bootcamp MSSA in Cloud Application 
                Development. Some of the development languages and tools that I am familiar 
                with are C#, ASP.NET, Azure, SQL, html, and javascript. 
            </p>
